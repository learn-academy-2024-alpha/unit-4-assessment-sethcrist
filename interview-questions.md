# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

I had to look this up so the similarities and differences is my researched answer

Similarities

1. Interpreted languages: code is executed by an interpreter at runtime which allows developers to write and see the results quickly. 
2. Dynamic typing: variable types are determined at runtime rather than at compile time and variables can hold all types of data.
3. Object oriented: both support OOP, this allows develpers to create objects that has data and functions related to that data.

Differences

1. Primary use cases: Javascript is mainly used for making web pages interactive where as Ruby is used mainly for back-end development
2. Currency models: Javascript efficient for tasks that involve handling numerous simultaneous connections. Ruby uses a thread-based model, which can be simple to understand 
3. Syntax and style: Javascript is influenced by C, a somewhat stricter language and ruby allows for multiple ways to accomplish the same task.

Researched answer:

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: This means to write the tests first before writing the code.

Researched answer: In Test driven developement software developers write the test before the code ensureing the code behaves the way they want it.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: In Ruby a block is code a section of code ending with curly braces.

Researched answer: A block is a section of code defined with "do" and end or with curly braces

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: Its a tool to help manage multiple software versions such as programming languages on a single system. It alos keeps track of every modification to the code in a specific kind of database.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol is the foundation of the web. Its used to load webpages using hypertext links by sending a request to the server, the server then processes the request then sends the website data back.

2. Model validations: It ensure data entering your application meets certain criteria before it's saved to the database.

3. Params: A collection of key-value pairs sent by the client to the server as part of an HTTP request
